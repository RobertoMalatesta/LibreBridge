# LibreBridge
LibreBridge an open source and cross-platform contract bridge game, with the goal of being a portable alternative to the excellent Bridge Baron.

### Current features:
* Bidding
* Playing
* Scoring
* Randomly-playing AI

### Planned features:
* GUI (text-only for now, leaning towards Qt)
* Cross-platform (tested on Linux only so far, but the code should compile for most systems)
* Better AI
* Peer-to-peer network play

## To build:
Just run 'make' in this very directory!
