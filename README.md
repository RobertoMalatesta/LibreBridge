### Current features:
* Bidding
* Playing
* Scoring
* Randomly-playing AI

### Planned features:
* GUI (not actually playable yet, unlike text-only mode)
* Cross-platform (tested on Linux only so far, but the code should compile for most systems)
* Better AI
* Peer-to-peer network play

## To build:
Be sure to install Qt 5 or newer (it's currently not up to date for many distros). Then, just run 'qmake' then 'make' in this very directory!
