# LibreBridge
LibreBridge an open source and cross-platform contract bridge game, with the goal of being a portable alternative to the excellent Bridge Baron.

### Current features:

### Planned features:
* GUI (text-only for now)
* Cross-platform (tested on Linux only so far, but the code should compile for most systems)

## To build:
Just run 'qmake' then 'make' in this very directory!
